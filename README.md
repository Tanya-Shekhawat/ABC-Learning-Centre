ABC Learning Centre
About: ABC Learning Center is an IT training institute where learners grasp the fundamentals of programming languages. They want to move forward and expand their network globally and want all interested students to get a chance to learn from their institute but they couldnâ€™t do it cause of not having their own digital platform for their IT Learning Center. Since ABC Learning center was never introduced to digitalization all their work was done manually which led to many difficulties such as, the registration of leads would be done manually on paper and sometimes the paper were misplaced, sometimes the written handwriting was too difficult to understand which caused in losing the potential customers. Doing work manually took a lot of time which directly caused a decrement in productivity.
